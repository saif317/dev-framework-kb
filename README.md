# Software Development Framework Knowledge Base

A living, versioned knowledge base capturing design, architecture, and system-design concepts for easy reference and agent-driven guidance.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive reference framework for software development, informed by three core pillars:

1. **System Design** - Scalable system architecture patterns and practices
2. **Software Architecture** - Code organization, design patterns, and structural decisions  
3. **Software Design & Architecture** - Best practices bridging design principles with implementation

The knowledge base is designed to be:
- **Queryable**: Structured for easy search and retrieval
- **Agent-friendly**: Optimized for AI assistant integration and automated guidance
- **Living**: Continuously updated with new learnings and industry best practices
- **Versioned**: Track evolution of concepts and maintain historical context

## Key Features

### 🔍 Queryable Structure
- Consistent markdown formatting with searchable tags
- Cross-referenced concepts with internal linking
- Categorized by complexity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

### 🤖 Agent Integration Ready
- Structured metadata for AI assistant consumption
- Standardized prompt templates for specific use cases
- Machine-readable concept relationships

### 📚 Comprehensive Coverage
- **System Design**: Distributed systems, scalability, reliability patterns
- **Software Architecture**: Clean architecture, DDD, microservices, monoliths
- **Design Patterns**: GoF patterns, architectural patterns, anti-patterns

### 🔄 Version Control
- Git-based versioning for all knowledge artifacts
- Change tracking for concept evolution
- Branching strategy for experimental concepts

## Usage

### For Developers
```bash
# Clone the knowledge base
git clone https://github.com/saif317/dev-framework-kb.git

# Search for specific concepts
grep -r "microservices" docs/

# Browse by category
ls docs/system-design/
```

### For AI Assistants
This repository is structured to serve as a reference for AI assistants:

1. **Context Injection**: Use entire sections as context for specific queries
2. **Template Generation**: Leverage templates for consistent outputs
3. **Progressive Guidance**: Navigate from basic to advanced concepts

### Query Examples
- "Show me the microservices communication patterns"
- "What are the trade-offs between monolith and microservices?"
- "Generate a system design checklist for e-commerce platforms"
