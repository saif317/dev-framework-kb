- Code review checklists
- Project setup templates
- Documentation templates

### üìö Examples (`examples/`)
Real-world case studies, implementation examples, and practical demonstrations.

**Contains:**
- Architecture case studies
- Code examples
- System design walkthroughs
- Pattern implementations
- Best practice demonstrations

## Content Standards

### Markdown Structure
All content follows a consistent markdown structure:

```markdown
# Topic Title

## Metadata
- **Category**: [System Design|Software Architecture|Design Architecture]
- **Complexity**: [Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced]
- **Tags**: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
- **Related**: [Links to related concepts]

## Overview
Brief description of the concept

## Key Concepts
Core principles and ideas

## Implementation
Practical guidance and examples

## Trade-offs
Pros, cons, and considerations

## Real-world Examples
Practical applications

## References
External resources and further reading
```

### Tagging System
Consistent tagging for easy searchability:

- **Technology**: #microservices #api #database #cache
- **Patterns**: #singleton #factory #observer #mvc
- **Concepts**: #scalability #performance #security #maintainability
- **Level**: #beginner #intermediate #advanced

### Cross-referencing

## Usage for AI Assistants

### Context Injection
Each document is structured to provide complete context for AI assistants:

1. **Metadata section** for quick categorization
2. **Overview section** for high-level understanding
3. **Implementation section** for practical guidance
4. **Examples section** for concrete applications

### Query Patterns
Optimized for common AI assistant queries:

- "Explain [concept] with examples"
- "Compare [A] vs [B] trade-offs"
- "Generate checklist for [scenario]"
- "Show implementation of [pattern]"

### Progressive Complexity
Content is organized to support progressive learning:

1. **Beginner**: Fundamental concepts and definitions
2. **Intermediate**: Practical applications and patterns
3. **Advanced**: Complex scenarios and optimization strategies
